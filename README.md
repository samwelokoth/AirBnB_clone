 # 0x00 Airbnb Clone - The Console

## Overview
This is a console application that mimics the functionality of the popular accommodation platform, Airbnb. Users can search and book accommodations, as well as manage their listings. This project aims to provide an interactive experience similar to what users would find on the actual website.

## Features
- Search accommodations by location, price range, and dates
- View detailed information about each listing
- Book accommodations with ease
- Manage your own listings (add/edit/delete)

## Technologies Used
- Python (for backend development)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL (for database management)
- Flask (web framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend)
- Git (version control system)

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher if not already installed.
2. Set up a virtual environment using `python -m venv env` command and activate it with `source env/bin/activate`.
3. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the application with `flask run` from the terminal.

## Usage Instructions
Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. From here, you can use the application like you would on the real Airbnb website.

### To search for accommodations:
- Input your desired destination, check-in date, and check-out date. Optionally, specify a maximum price. Click "Search".

### To view details of a specific listing:
- Find the listing you're interested in and click on its title or image. A new page will load with more information about the property.

### To book a listing:
- After selecting a listing, fill out the booking form with your personal information and payment details. Submit the form to complete the reservation process.

### To manage your listings:
- If you have any active listings, there should be a dashboard accessible from the main menu where you can add, edit, or delete your properties.

Please note that this is a simple console implementation of the Airbnb concept. It does not include all features found on the full website or mobile app.
